# RLFighter: AI-Driven Fighting Game Strategy with Reinforcement Learning

*RLFighter* is an advanced *reinforcement learning* project designed to enhance *fighting game strategies* in games like *Street Fighter. The AI agents leverage **Q-Learning* and *Deep Q-Networks (DQN)* to interact with the game environment, learning optimal moves and strategies for competitive gameplay.

## Key Features

- *Intelligent Agent Training*  
  - Agents are trained in a simulated environment to learn and refine *gameplay strategies*.

- *Deep Q-Networks (DQN)*  
  - Uses *Deep Reinforcement Learning* to develop *optimal strategic moves* based on past experiences.

- *Performance Optimization*  
  - Real-time feedback and *automatic strategy adjustments* improve gameplay effectiveness.

- *Environment Interaction*  
  - Agents continuously *adapt* their moves based on opponent behavior and in-game conditions.

## Skills & Technologies

- *Reinforcement Learning*: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)  
- *Deep Neural Networks: AI-driven **gameplay strategy optimization*  
- *Performance Analysis*: Win rate tracking, success rate of strategic moves  
- *Game Environment Simulation*: Training agents through interactive game simulations
